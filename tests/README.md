# Test Script to check basic function

In order to test in PHP5 as well, we decided not use PHPUnit and do the foolishly naive tests instead.

- Run this test in Alpine Linux OS as below:

  ```bash
  $ composer test
  ```

- Or, if you have Docker installed then run:

  ```bash
  $ composer test-docker
  ```

**NOTE:** These tests won't be published in Packagist. Reason and details see:
